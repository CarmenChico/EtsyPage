If you\u2019d like a sample to see if this is a compatible format, then feel free to send me a message. I do NOT offer refunds. Some of these designs might be intricate, and clean cutting will be determined by a multitude of factors, such as blade\/mat\/cutter, since I cannot foresee these factors, it\u2019s up to you to decide what your cutter can handle. These are instant download, and you are responsible for downloading them yourself. Extra fees may be incurred for any further service. You are also responsible for general computer knowledge, and unzipping the files. Thanks for understanding.\n\nBULK ORDERS: If you are buying more than 8 items, contact me for a customized listing for a lower price. These reduced prices are not a flat rate, and are subject to change for many reasons. I typically price them with any promotions I have going in mind, so you may be responsible for entering in a coupon code.\n\nCOMMERCIAL USE: When you purchase this listing, you have my permission to sell PHYSICAL products you&#39;ve made from this file. Decals are acceptable and count as physical products.

You are under no requirement to source me when sharing or selling your items, however please don&#39;t take credit for the file itself, this causes confusion and effects the validity of my shop, and effectively makes you guilty of defamation. The license is 100 items per &quot;picture&quot; or &quot;piece&quot; of a purchase. (For example, if you purchased a set of 4 digital subway art signs in one listing, you could make up to 400 physical products for sale.) If you need to extend this license just contact me, as my main goal is to keep my art in small shops, and not mass production.\n\nPERMISSIONS: If you need to alter this file for your own use, you are allowed to, (for example, users who are skilled enough to know how to convert these to embroidery files)however I cannot guarantee quality of any form not sold directly via the shop.

Locate to zipped folder, right click and select &quot;extract all&quot; Delete the zipped folder to stop confusion. DO NOT CLICK DIRECTLY ON SVG. Depending on YOUR computers settings, you might see what looks like an internet explorer icon beside the SVG. This will open your SVG as a webpage picture. To use this svg you will need to open your program FIRST, then open the svg from the program. DIRECTLY CLICKING ON SVG WILL NOT RESULT IN IT OPENING IN YOUR DESIRED PROGRAM. (Unless, of coarse, you&#39;ve programmed the computer to do so) \r\n\r\nFOR SILHOUETTE USERS: Open your silhouette studio. Click file &gt; open and select the extracted folder you&#39;ve created. Depending on the version of your software, from here you can open the dxf or svg version of the file in your software. Select all of the items in the file and right click and select ungroup. From here you can delete what you do not intend to cut at the moment, then you will need to select the item and use your right side panel under &quot;cut settings&quot; and select &quot;cut&quot; to make this file cut out in your program. \r\n\r\nFOR CRICUT USERS: Open design space, sign in (very important! Cricut does not inform you when it is not signed in, but will also not allow you to upload svgs) Select upload, vector upload (currently the left option) and select the unzipped folder and svg. Select upload and rename, add tags for easy location of the file later. From there you can open the svg and right click and select ungroup & remove any unwanted designs. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m more than willing to help with opening, but please please please read through this first, as it covers the basic instructions for most of the emails I&#39;ve answered in the past.

I am always happy to help other shop owners, and encourage you to send me any listings so that I can share to my own fan base. You may create up to 100 items with each design in a file. (So if a file has 4 designs, you can sell of 100 of EACH design, make sense?)\n\nI HAVE A HIGH VOLUME SHOP, DO I NEED TO PURCHASE AN EXTENDED LICENSE?\nNope. If you need to make more than 100 items of one design, just simply let me know you would like to.\n\nHELP! I&#39;M USING SCAL AND MY FILE IS DISTORTED!\nUnfortunately, SCAL and my files sometimes don&#39;t agree. I now have a fix for this- which I will gladly do free of charge. Just shoot me a message! It basically comes down to me opening the file in illustrator and resaving it- so it takes no time at all. Everyone who brings these translations issues to light helps tremendously- so I can update the files that are causing problems for all of the future customers. So PLEASE don&#39;t stay quiet- I don&#39;t bite, I promise!\n\nWHY ARE ALL THE DESIGNS IN ONE FILE?\nI&#39;ve stopped doing this, but most of the store is designs gathered into one file. When I first started, I ran a poll asking which people would prefer, and the overwhelming majority (in 2014) liked them group. Apparently we&#39;ve evolved as SVG users, because I ran another poll recently and the answer changed. :) While I won&#39;t be going back and separating old files - it&#39;s easy to use the designs seperately. Simply ungroup them in your program and remove the designs you are not currently using.  \n\nEach listing states how many files (& what types) are included in each set.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1456500718,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/CraftyLittleNodes?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/123\/0\/10365179\/iusb_760x100.17776124_ro2d.jpg","num_favorers":3283,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/137\/0\/10365179\/isla_fullxfull.22307753_k2mq7su9.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":true,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":true,"has_unstructured_policies":true,"custom_shops_state":1}},{"listing_id":473447440,"state":"active","user_id":30355481,"category_id":69150467,"title":"Saxophone Pewter Motif On Silver Plated Tape Measure Jazz Music Teacher Musician gift Mother Father Christmas Gift","description":"This unique and useful silver plated measuring tape would make the ideal gift for any Jazz Music enthusiast!\n\nMade to a high standard, it measures in Inches and Millimetres to a total length of 39&quot; inches (one metre). \n\nThe front side of the tape measure case has a pewter motif fashioned in the form of a Saxophone, and a plain case on the back.

Saxophones are usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. The saxophone family was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in 1840. Adolphe Sax wanted to create a group or series of instruments that would be the most powerful and vocal of the woodwinds, and the most adaptive of the brass that would fill the vacant middle ground between the two sections. He patented the saxophone on June 28, 1846, in two groups of seven instruments each. Each series consisted of instruments of various sizes in alternating transposition. The series pitched in B\u266d and E\u266d, designed for military bands, have proved extremely popular and most saxophones encountered today are from this series. Instruments from the so-called &quot;orchestral&quot; series, pitched in C and F, never gained a foothold, and the B\u266d and E\u266d instruments have now replaced the C and F instruments when the saxophone is used in the orchestra.\n\nThe saxophone is commonly used in classical music (such as concert bands, chamber music, and solo repertoire), military bands (such as military concert bands, marching bands, etc.), marching bands, and jazz (such as big bands, jazz combos, etc.). Saxophone players are called saxophonists.","creation_tsz":1477147358,"ending_tsz":1487778158,"original_creation_tsz":1467181009,"last_modified_tsz":1477147358,"price":"9.99","currency_code":"GBP","quantity":9,"tags":["Evolution t-shirt","t-shirt","Saxphonist t-shirt","Saxophone  t-shirt"],"category_path":["Clothing","Shirt"],"category_path_ids":[69150353,68889876],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":16996517,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1467181009,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/463086643\/evolution-to-saxophonist-t-shirt-funny?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":20,"num_favorers":0,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"unisex_adults","occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":482,"taxonomy_path":["Clothing","Unisex Adult Clothing","Tops & Tees","T-shirts"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":1000339588,"hex_code":"C8C4BA","red":200,"green":196,"blue":186,"hue":43,"saturation":7,"brightness":78,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1467181010,"listing_id":463086643,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/135\/0\/10844595\/il_75x75.1000339588_3jww.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/135\/0\/10844595\/il_170x135.1000339588_3jww.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/135\/0\/10844595\/il_570xN.1000339588_3jww.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/135\/0\/10844595\/il_fullxfull.1000339588_3jww.jpg","full_height":941,"full_width":800},{"listing_image_id":1000339590,"hex_code":"ACADA1","red":172,"green":173,"blue":161,"hue":65,"saturation":6,"brightness":67,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1467181010,"listing_id":463086643,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/136\/0\/10844595\/il_75x75.1000339590_s9wf.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/136\/0\/10844595\/il_170x135.1000339590_s9wf.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/136\/0\/10844595\/il_570xN.1000339590_s9wf.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/136\/0\/10844595\/il_fullxfull.1000339590_s9wf.jpg","full_height":1313,"full_width":1100},{"listing_image_id":1020878681,"hex_code":"CDCCCD","red":205,"green":204,"blue":205,"hue":300,"saturation":0,"brightness":80,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1467181010,"listing_id":463086643,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/0\/10844595\/il_75x75.1020878681_n85a.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/0\/10844595\/il_170x135.1020878681_n85a.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/0\/10844595\/il_570xN.1020878681_n85a.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/0\/10844595\/il_fullxfull.1020878681_n85a.jpg","full_height":1249,"full_width":1100},{"listing_image_id":1046869885,"hex_code":"A6C3E4","red":166,"green":195,"blue":228,"hue":212,"saturation":27,"brightness":89,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1467181010,"listing_id":463086643,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/123\/0\/10844595\/il_75x75.1046869885_fzq6.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/123\/0\/10844595\/il_170x135.1046869885_fzq6.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/123\/0\/10844595\/il_570xN.1046869885_fzq6.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/123\/0\/10844595\/il_fullxfull.1046869885_fzq6.jpg","full_height":1301,"full_width":1100},{"listing_image_id":1046869891,"hex_code":"CFCACA","red":207,"green":202,"blue":202,"hue":0,"saturation":2,"brightness":81,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1467181010,"listing_id":463086643,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/10844595\/il_75x75.1046869891_ee2u.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/10844595\/il_170x135.1046869891_ee2u.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/10844595\/il_570xN.1046869891_ee2u.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/126\/0\/10844595\/il_fullxfull.1046869891_ee2u.jpg","full_height":801,"full_width":750}],"Shop":{"shop_id":10844595,"shop_name":"catbatart","user_id":60820651,"creation_tsz":1426101715,"title":"The Art of T-Shirts","announcement":"I have a shop in Fleetwood Lancashire England in the UK.

Thanks for visiting, and happy shopping!\r\n\r\nHolly :)","policy_payment":"I accept major credit cards, Etsy gift cards, and Paypal.  I won&#39;t charge any tax unless I find out later I&#39;m supposed to.  If you ordered something, and need to cancel an order, you can cancel any item that has not yet been shipped.  If it has already been shipped, please see below for my return policy.  Just please message me if you have any problems at all, and I will do my best to ensure that you are happy with your purchase!  :) ","policy_shipping":"I apologize for the inconvenience, but I can only offer free shipping to locations within the continental US, and only on quantity orders.  You don&#39;t have to buy two of the same thing, just any two items, even if they are on clearance.  If you live outside the continental US, or if you are only buying one item, the shipping will be calculated accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf you want faster shipping, you can choose the expedited shipping icon and add it to your cart.  If you are overcharged for shipping, I will refund any shipping overages back to you.  I try to keep your shipping cost as low as possible!  I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want to be spending your money on shipping; you want to be spending it on great items from my shop!  ;)\r\n\r\nMy goal is to ship all orders within the first five business days of my receipt of the order (unless it is a custom order or if the order includes a custom item).  If for some reason, I cannot send your order out within five business days, I will contact you.  If you are ordering several items and only part of your order is custom made, please let me know if you would like your non-custom items shipped separately, i.e. more quickly, and we will work something out.\r\n\r\nRemember, I really want you to be happy with your purchase!  :)","policy_refunds":"Feel free to return any order\/item for a full refund, but you would have to pay for the return shipping.  You may return any item for any reason within 14 days of your receipt of the item, as long as it is in resaleable condition.  On some occasions, there may be extenuating circumstances in which I will also cover return shipping, but I decide that on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\nIf it is not in resaleable condition, please message me about it, especially if it wasn&#39;t your fault (eg. damaged during shipping),and I will try to help you with it.  Please feel free to message me about any problems you have so and I will do my best to make sure you are happy with your purchase.  :)","policy_additional":"I am willing to do custom orders on most of my listed merchandise, for example, if you want something similar but in a different color, etc.  Special orders may, however, take longer, and\/or incur an additional fee.  I usually don&#39;t charge extra as long as the custom order does not require any supplies that I don&#39;t normally keep on hand, or if the special supply was something I was going to buy anyway.  Then too, it depends on how difficult the item will be to make, and also, of course, on what all else is going on in my crazy life!  :)  Custom orders may not be possible at all, especially as it gets closer to Christmas.\r\n\r\nIf you are dissatisfied with your purchase for any reason, please contact me, and I will do my best to make you happy with it.
