Go here:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.Lennymud.etsy.com \r\n\r\nHello Fabulous People!  I like to create happy stuff that makes people smile. \r\nHere are answers to the most commonly asked questions about my shop:\r\n\r\nWHAT IS UP WITH SHIPPING COSTS?\r\nShipping is based on weight and destination. I have recently switched to Etsy&#39;s calculated shipping.  This program bases the cost of shipping on how far away you are from me (in New Jersey) an dhow much your item weighs--the average mug is 2 lbs. when boxed.  This mean that East Coast people are getting huge savings, while those of you on the West Coast may be clutching your chest and wondering what the heck happened.  Before you send me a note demanding to know why sometimes the cost to ship far away is sometimes more than the cost of the item itself;  please be aware that I do not rule the world and do not set the current postal rates.  IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY ON SHIPPING order multiple items!  While 2lbs, (or a single mug) will cost $ 10.77, you can have TWO MUGS shipped Medium Flat Rate for $ 11.95. Or have three items shipped UPS for $ 14.00.  If you have any questions please leave me a message in the &quot;note to seller&quot; field at checkout.  I REFUND ALL SHIPPING OVERAGES TO YOUR METHOD OF PAYMENT.   \r\n\r\nCAN I SEND IT TO SOMEONE OTHER THAN MYSELF?\r\nAbsolutely!  Happy to help you make someone else happy!  Etsy will let you enter in a different ship to address- please leave me a note at checkout that you would like me to include with the item instead of a receipt so that they know it is a gift from you.  I wrap for safety in bubble and clean brown kraft paper, I do not gift wrap, sorry!  \r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER EXPEDITED SHIPPING?\r\nSo sorry-  I do not offer expedited shipping--but I do rush your order out the door as quickly as possible!! I often ship NEXT DAY (not on weekends, tho) Average shipping times are: USA East Coast 1-3 days, West Coast 3-5 days, Canada 2 weeks, Europe and AU 3 weeks. \r\n\r\nDO YOU WHOLESALE\r\nSo sorry- I have a great day job as a designer for a line of ceramics sold world wide.   My employment contract prohibits me from engaging in any wholesale activities regardless of how different my handmade, weekend work is.  Sorry to disappoint!\r\n\r\nDO YOU TAKE CUSTOM ORDERS\r\nDue to my shop volume, I do not take custom orders- so sorry to disappoint.  I hope you can find another Etsy seller to help you.\r\n\r\nBecause this is not my day job, I can be slow to answer convos.  Apologies in advance for any delay in responding to your inquiries. Please mark anything particularly time sensitive with URGENT.  I also welcome any URGENT messages be texted to me at 917 921 6142.  I will not accept your phone call as I have difficulty hearing, but am happy to respond to an urgent text. \r\n\r\nI use all lead free, non toxic, eco friendly clays and glazes.  Testing certificates available upon request.  All items are made to be used and enjoyed- dishwasher and microwave safe.  I ship using recycled materials and do not use styrofoam peanuts because those things are bad for our planet!

Go here:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.Lennymud.etsy.com \r\n\r\nHello Fabulous People!  I like to create happy stuff that makes people smile. \r\nHere are answers to the most commonly asked questions about my shop:\r\n\r\nWHAT IS UP WITH SHIPPING COSTS?\r\nShipping is based on weight and destination. I have recently switched to Etsy&#39;s calculated shipping.  This program bases the cost of shipping on how far away you are from me (in New Jersey) an dhow much your item weighs--the average mug is 2 lbs. when boxed.  This mean that East Coast people are getting huge savings, while those of you on the West Coast may be clutching your chest and wondering what the heck happened.  Before you send me a note demanding to know why sometimes the cost to ship far away is sometimes more than the cost of the item itself;  please be aware that I do not rule the world and do not set the current postal rates.  IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY ON SHIPPING order multiple items!  While 2lbs, (or a single mug) will cost $ 10.77, you can have TWO MUGS shipped Medium Flat Rate for $ 11.95. Or have three items shipped UPS for $ 14.00.  If you have any questions please leave me a message in the &quot;note to seller&quot; field at checkout.  I REFUND ALL SHIPPING OVERAGES TO YOUR METHOD OF PAYMENT.   \r\n\r\nCAN I SEND IT TO SOMEONE OTHER THAN MYSELF?\r\nAbsolutely!  Happy to help you make someone else happy!  Etsy will let you enter in a different ship to address- please leave me a note at checkout that you would like me to include with the item instead of a receipt so that they know it is a gift from you.  I wrap for safety in bubble and clean brown kraft paper, I do not gift wrap, sorry!  \r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER EXPEDITED SHIPPING?\r\nSo sorry-  I do not offer expedited shipping--but I do rush your order out the door as quickly as possible!! I often ship NEXT DAY (not on weekends, tho) Average shipping times are: USA East Coast 1-3 days, West Coast 3-5 days, Canada 2 weeks, Europe and AU 3 weeks. \r\n\r\nDO YOU WHOLESALE\r\nSo sorry- I have a great day job as a designer for a line of ceramics sold world wide.   My employment contract prohibits me from engaging in any wholesale activities regardless of how different my handmade, weekend work is.  Sorry to disappoint!\r\n\r\nDO YOU TAKE CUSTOM ORDERS\r\nDue to my shop volume, I do not take custom orders- so sorry to disappoint.  I hope you can find another Etsy seller to help you.\r\n\r\nBecause this is not my day job, I can be slow to answer convos.  Apologies in advance for any delay in responding to your inquiries. Please mark anything particularly time sensitive with URGENT.  I also welcome any URGENT messages be texted to me at 917 921 6142.  I will not accept your phone call as I have difficulty hearing, but am happy to respond to an urgent text. \r\n\r\nI use all lead free, non toxic, eco friendly clays and glazes.  Testing certificates available upon request.  All items are made to be used and enjoyed- dishwasher and microwave safe.  I ship using recycled materials and do not use styrofoam peanuts because those things are bad for our planet!
